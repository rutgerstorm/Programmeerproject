## What are the differences between countries in CO2 emission and how are these built up?

On November 30th till December 12th 2015, the Climate Summit took place in Paris. The results were promising, 195 countries signed the “Agreement of Paris”. The Netherlands signed the agreement as well, which means they have to reduce their CO2-emission before 2030 with 49%. Almost all the countries will have to reduce their CO2-emission strongly in order to reach the agreement. But first things first, what does the actual CO2 in all the countries look like through different sectors?


1.	Interactive world map with the CO2 emission per country and the possibility to change the year. 

2.	Barchart which visualises the share to the worldwide CO2-emission of every country. 

3.	Circle diagram for every country which visualises the share of each production sector in the nationaal CO2 emission.

External Components
D3 Library, another libraries might follow

There is visualization that uses all three subjects that I got
Challenges
It will be hard to parse through all the given data, it is data from every country, for different sectors for a period of more than 40 years. Thereby it might be hard to make the circle diagram for every country due the lack of data.
