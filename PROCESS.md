#day 2 08-01-19
The object for today was writing a design document in markdown.   
Yesterday I already found the datasets which I needed, so that was good.  
But the making of this design document really gave me an insight in the way my data   
has to be organized and written to JSON files.

#day3 – 09-01-19
Yesterday gave me insight in which way my data should be converted to JSON files.  
So I started off with converting the data for making the world map and the barchart.  
This took more time than expected, but the job was done. Made a start for converting the other datasets. 

#day4 – 10-01-19
The regions converter is done, made a start with the converter for the piechart.  
Already uploaded these in javascript.

#day5 11-01-19
Called in sick.

#day6 14-01-19
Almost every dataset converted to the right JSON format, except for the country barchart.  
But now ready to start with the worldmap. The country barchart is very hard because there was  
a dataset missing so I’ve have to combine 3 datasets from different length and format.

#day7 15-01-19
Made a good start with the worldmap, the worldmap is drawn but not ready yet. Data about  
the paris has to be linked to the countries and layout isn’t finished. 

#day8 16-01-19
Able to link the Paris data to the countries, layout is as good as done. 

#day 9 17-01-19
Started to finish the country barchart data, but even with assistance I’ve not been able  
to get the data in the right format. I’ve realized this barchart might be to challenging for  
how much time is left. This Friday is the deadline for the alpha-version so I’ve changed plans.  
The worldmap stays, but I’m going to make a linechart which shows the CO2 emission for the country on  
which is clicked in the worldmap. Then the linechart shows the graph from 2000 till 2014, the user is  
able to click on this years in the linegraph. Then a barchart shows how this CO2 emission is divided through  
the different energysectors. This plan seems much more realistic than the previous, so there’s quite a lot  
work to catch up with.

#day10 18-01-19
Started with making the linegraph and now the line is visible. The graphs are missing and the line has  
to be scaled with d3.mix and d3.max. Then it’s done. But confident that this plan will work out.

#day11 21-01-19
Started with finishing of the linegraph, this went very well. Line is scaled, axis are present and  
it is linked to the worldmap. So if you click a country, the graphs shows the right data. Made a start  
with the barchart but the x position of the bars says ‘Nan’. So it shows only 1 bar. 

#day12 22-01-19
Barchart is fixed and added a scatter to the linegrahph. Which made to line graph interactive,  
so next step is to link the linegraph with the barchart.

#day13 23-01-19
Linked the barchart with the linegraph and made an update function but is a bit buggy.

#day14 24-01-19
Hackathon, but started off with making a tooltip.

#day15 25-01-19
Made a dropdown button work, slider is present but not working that well. Update function is finished.  
Tooltip is working but needs some layout. 

#day16 28-01-19
Finally the colors are added for the worldmap, including a legend. Did some more styling and the slider  
works but only for the first country input. So it doesn’t get the updated country input.

#day17 29-01-19
The slider is now working as it should, tooltips are added. Some scaling done and created the license.md.

#day18 30-01-19
The last tasks are done, mostly scaling, cleaning up and commenting code
