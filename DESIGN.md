For the visualizations I'm planning to create, the following data is needed. A list of the CO2 emission per country, a list of the CO2 emission per region and a list of the CO2 emission per country, per sector.  
The following links contain all the data needed.

Data Sources  
> [Emission by region](https://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/trends/emis/tre_regional.html)  
> [Emission by nation](https://cdiac.ess-dive.lbl.gov/trends/emis/tre_coun.html)  
> [Emission by Sector](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-and-other-greenhouse-gas-emissions#emissions-by-sector)  

The data is stored as csv and has to be parsed.
