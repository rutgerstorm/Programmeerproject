## Final report Programmeerproject

### Summary

My webpage contains a worldmap which shows, which countries signed the Paris Agreement. The user can hoover over every country and when the users clicks on a country the following happens. A linegraph is shown, which shows the total CO2 emission of this country from 2000 till 2014. The user can click on a year in this linegraph, then a barchart is shown. The barchart visualizes how the CO2 of this country in this year is divided through different sectors.
